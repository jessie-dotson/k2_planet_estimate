# Estimating how many planets are in the K2 data.

This repository contains the analysis described in the research note "Hundreds More Planets Await Discovery in Kepler's K2 Data Set" by Dotson, Barentsen, Hedges, & Coughlin.  (https://doi.org/10.3847/2515-5172/ab01c6)

The analysis was performed in R and can be found in the rmd directory and is split between two .rmd files, one which grooms the available information about K2 targets and one which calculates the predicted number of discoverable K2 exoplanets.  These can be run using R.  (The Rstudio interface is lovely and highly recommended.)

Alternatively, the output of each Rmarkdown file can also be found in the rmd directory in the .md files  To skip straight to the output see https://github.com/jessie-dotson/k2_planet_estimate/blob/master/rmd/k2_planet_estimate_v2.md for the planet estimate and https://github.com/jessie-dotson/k2_planet_estimate/blob/master/rmd/K2target_planetestimate.md for the grooming of the K2 targets.
